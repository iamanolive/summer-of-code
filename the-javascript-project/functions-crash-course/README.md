# functions crash course

* tutorial uploaded on the freecodecamp [youtube channel](https://youtu.be/j1laALb8OVM?si=9xY4xl5f7fxC93sf)

* function declaration == function definition
* function can have only one rest parameter and it must be the last parameter in the sequence

* variable defined inside a function cannot be accessed from outside of that function.
* a function can access everything defined within the scope in which it is defined.
